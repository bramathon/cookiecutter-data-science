# Initializing the project:

## Initialize git

```bash
git init
```

## Initialize dvc

```bash
dvc init
git commit -m 'Initialized DVC'
```

## Add your data

The first thing to do is add the raw data. Put it in data/raw and use the dvc add command eg.

```bash
cp raw_data.csv to data/raw/
docker-compose run --rm dvc add 
```

## Downloading data

Use the DVC pull and push commands to pull the data files from the cache. The DVC docker container can be used for this:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm dvc pull
docker-compose run --rm dvc push
```

## Train the model (example)

To build the project, run

```bash
docker-compose run dvc repro
```

# Built-in Infrastructure

## CircleCI config

The `.circleci/config.yml` file provides automated build and test.

## Pre-commit hooks

For more info: https://pre-commit.com/

The pre-commit hooks automatically runs the linter and checks that large files are not commited to the repo on each commit.

To enable it, run the command (in the pipenv or docker):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

It's a good idea to actually run the checks on the current repo once enabled

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To add new hooks, edit the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
